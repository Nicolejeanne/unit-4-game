## JQuery Assignment

I am currently a student in the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. After covering the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript we are now completing our week 5 assignment. For this assignment we are tasked with making a game called *Crystal Collector* using JQuery.

I hope you enjoy checking it out.

### Here's how the game should work:

1. Choose a theme for your game! 

2. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

3. Display the following on the page:

     * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

     * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

     * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

         * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

         * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

         * Each crystal should have a value between 1 - 12.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number between 19 - 120.. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
